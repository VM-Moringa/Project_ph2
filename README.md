## 1. Overview

Based on the Northwestern county real estate data set, this is a real estate analysis for a hypothetical real estate agency to find trends and useful information that can be applied to improve sales.
## 2. Business Problem
Using the sales data we want to predict sales of properties for a real estate agency. We are looking for features that may be used as a predictor of sale price for houses so that the agency can know what to look for in a property to increase its valuation and hence profit. We are going to use linear regression analysis to predict the features with the most correlation to sales price.
## 4. Modelling
Here we shall start the modelling process. This is going to establish the viability of our model against a baseline model. Then we are going to interpret the model to get a prediction of which features the real estate agency should focus on to predict the price of a house and hence the best returns.
## 5. Regression Results

The final model is statistically significant overall and explains 55% of the variance in house sale price. This is about 6% more variance explained than our base line model and 5% more than our numeric model. Using an alpha of 0.05 our intercept is statistically significant and only coefficients of fair and poor house condition are not significant.
 
The biggest predictors of house sale price with the most impact seem to be number of bathrooms, floors and whether or not a house has a waterfront. Square footage of living area of a house also has an impact. Although it may not seem large, it has a big impact in that it probably varies by a lot since it is a small measurement compared to the total size. This four features are the ones that are going to be reported on to the stakeholder. The overall condition of the house is going to be left out as some measures seem to be insignificant.

## Conclusion

The four main predictors of house sale price for our real estate agency to focus on are:
    1. Square footage of living area
    2. Number of bathrooms in a house
    3. Number of floors 
    4. Whether or not a house has a waterfront

Living area space seems to be the main predictor and waterfront houses sell at the highest prices. These should be the foremost considerations when considering houses to sell.
